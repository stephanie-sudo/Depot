        "item5": {
          "question": "Are remote sessions effective?",

      "text": "Energy work addresses the finely woven network of meridians, chakras, auric layers, and bioelectric fields that enliven your body and mind. Through targeted touch, holds, rhythmic tapping, conscious breathing, and gently flowing movements, blocked currents are plugged back in, strengthened, and harmonized. When useful, tuning fork vibrations sweep through tissue and biofield to dissolve tension and re-order frequency patterns. In this way, your system activates its natural self-healing abilities, stress levels drop, vitality rises—and you arrive in a state of deep presence.",
